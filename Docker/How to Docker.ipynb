    "# How to Docker\n",
    "A guide written by [Jonny Langefeld](https://twitter.com/jonnylangefeld)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Docker?\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is a software container platform. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Developers** use Docker to eliminate “works on my machine” problems when collaborating on code with co-workers. \n",
    "- **Operators** use Docker to run and manage apps side-by-side in isolated containers to get better compute density. \n",
    "- **Enterprises** use Docker to build agile software delivery pipelines to ship new features faster, more securely and with confidence for both Linux and Windows Server apps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Docker Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Images\n",
    "\n",
    "A docker images is the **\"cooking recipe\"** for a container. It contains all the definitions how to boot up the linux environment. Typically one Docker image is there to fulfill specifically one task. For instance one image would define your webserver and another image would define the underlying database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "Containers are the **instantiations of images**. They are one form of the image. Compare it to object oriented programming, then your class would be an image and instance of the class a container. Another comparison would be to real containers on ship. They have a unidbody from the outside, but can look very different from the inside. Some interesting facts about containers:\n",
    "- containers are not persistent. As soon as you don't use them anymore they get stoped (or even deleted)\n",
    "- a container only lives for the time a process runs inside it which does not get killed (of course you could run processess which never send an exit command)\n",
    "- containers can include data however it's also not persistent. If you want to make it persistent, you can use volumes.\n",
    "- to communicate between containers, use the same protocolls as you would use to communicate between computers (e.g. tcp/ip)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Volumes\n",
    "\n",
    "Volumes can be used as **underlying data layer**. They can be used between as many containers as you want. All data stored in here could be used by all containers connected to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker comes with its own networking capabilities. The name of a container is its hostname. The easiest way to try this is to have two containers running and ping one container from inside the other container. Docker Compose will raise its own subnet.\n",

    "    To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:\n",
    "     1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.\n",
    "     2. The Docker daemon pulled the \"hello-world\" image from the Docker Hub.\n",
